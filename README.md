========

A simple Javascript experiment with casting 2D shadows from cyclic polygon shapes (polygons with vertices which can be inscribed in a circle).

Why?
====

This is personal project of mine, extended from the curiosity of creating lighting effects in Flash and the soft-shadows I've been built in GameMaker.

Current State
=============

Screenshot

* Hard-edged shadows are implemented for n-sided polygons and circles
* Soft-edged shadows are only an extended goal (the current attempt was premature)
* Multiple lights look *horrible*, but they all cast shadows
